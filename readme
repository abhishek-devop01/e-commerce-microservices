## üöÄ Key Features & Architectural Goals

The platform is designed around the principles of decoupling, elasticity, and intelligence:

* **Microservices Backend:** Ensuring independent service deployment and high **scalability**.
* **Gemini AI Integration:** Implementing advanced features like **personalized recommendations** and intelligent analytics.
* **End-to-End Functionality:** Covering all core e-commerce flows (catalog, auth, orders, payments).
* **Containerization:** Leveraging **Docker** for a smooth, reproducible environment from development to production.
* **Cloud Native:** Utilizing **AWS** for highly available and scalable cloud deployment.
