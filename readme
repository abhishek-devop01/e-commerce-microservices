## üí° Overview

Welcome to the repository for a brand new, full-stack **AI-Powered E-commerce Website**!

This project is an exciting journey into building a **highly scalable** and **intelligent** retail platform from the ground up, utilizing a modern **Microservices Architecture**. The core focus is to combine cutting-edge technology and creativity to rethink the online shopping experience through advanced personalization, recommendations, and analytics powered by Artificial Intelligence.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Goals

The ultimate goal is to deliver a functional, scalable e-commerce platform with the following key features:

* **Microservices Backend:** Decoupled services for optimal **scalability** and independent deployment (e.g., User Service, Product Service, Order Service).
* **AI Integration (Gemini):** Implementation of the Gemini API for advanced capabilities like:
    * **Personalized Product Recommendations**
    * **Intelligent Search and Filtering**
    * **Data Analysis** for market insights and user behavior.
* **Full-Stack Functionality:** Complete user flows from product browsing and search to checkout and order management.
* **Containerization:** Using **Docker** for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments across all services.
* **Cloud Deployment:** Utilizing **AWS** services for hosting, data storage, and scalable infrastructure, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Structure & Milestones

The project is structured around individual microservices, each ideally residing in its own dedicated folder or, eventually, a separate repository for true microservices deployment. Key milestones include:

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication (In Progress)**
    * Set up initial project structure and individual microservice repositories.
    * Implement core user authentication services: **Register, Login, and AuthMe APIs**.
    * Establish secure inter-service communication mechanisms (e.g., API Gateway, Message Broker).
    * **_Current Status: Register, Login, AuthMe APIs developed and unit tests passed!_**
2.  **Phase 2: Product & Catalog Service**
    * Develop robust APIs for CRUD operations on product data.
    * Implement advanced search, filtering, and categorization logic.
    * Integrate image storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3).
3.  **Phase 3: AI Integration & Recommendations**
    * Integrate the Gemini API for various AI features.
    * Build a dedicated recommendation engine service based on user behavior and product data.
    * Implement AI-powered search enhancements and content generation for product descriptions.
4.  **Phase 4: Order & Payment Management**
    * Create the Order Management Service, handling order creation, tracking, and status updates.
    * Integrate a secure third-party payment gateway.
    * Develop inventory management and stock updates.
5.  **Phase 5: Frontend Development & Cloud Deployment**
    * Develop the user-facing React application, consuming all backend APIs.
    * Containerize all services using Docker Compose for local development and Kubernetes for production.
    * Deploy the full-stack application to AWS, configuring EC2 instances, RDS, Load Balancers, etc.
